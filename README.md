If you prefer to clone the project locally, you can also get to the docs by navigating to http://`domain`:`port`/. Where `domain` is the domain of your server and `port` is the port of your server.
For example, if your server is running on port 5000, you can navigate to http://localhost:5000/.
There you will see a list of all endpoints and their descriptions.
